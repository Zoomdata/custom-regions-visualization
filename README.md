**Custom Regions Map Visualziations**

Custom Regions is a map visualization for use in [Zoomdata](http://www.zoomdata.com).  This visualization allows administrators to create a new chart with map regions to match their organization's data, area, and business processes.

As of version 2.3 the map visualizations in Zoomdata are only available for global countries, or for U.S. data at state, county, and zip code level.  The underlying data must have fields with names and values that match the existing code.  Administrators can use Chart Studio to create their own map visualization.  This sample does that, abstracting the region configuration information to make it easy to specify new regions.

Installation instructions are on the [wiki in Bitbucket](wiki/Home.md)
