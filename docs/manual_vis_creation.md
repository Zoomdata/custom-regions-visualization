If the import custom visualization step is not working, due to version issues or something else, the visualization can be created using Chart Studio.

Download the custom_regions.zip file to your machine, unzip it to a folder

Open custom_regions/components/styles.css in a text editor, select all and copy 

Create a new custom chart based on the 'US States' chart

Highlight all of the code in 'styles.css' and paste the copied code

Open the custome_regions/components/CustomRegionsMap.js from the extracted archive using a text editor , select all text and copy

Open visualization.js in Chart Studio.  Select all code and past the copied code.

Proceed with the [main instructions](./Home.md) to configure.
