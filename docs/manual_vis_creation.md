If the import custom visualization step is not working, due to version issues or something else, the visualization can be created using Chart Studio.

Download the custom_regions.zip file to your machine, unzip it to a folder

Open custom_regions/components/styles.css in a text editor, select all and copy

In Zoomdata (as a user with administrator access) open chart studio and create a new custom chart based on the 'US States' chart

Highlight all of the code in 'styles.css' and paste the copied code

Select the drop-down next to "zoomable-map.js" and select "Delete" from the drop-down menu

Open the custom_regions/components/CustomRegionsMap.js from the extracted archive using a text editor , select all text and copy

In chart studio click the green "Add" button and name the new file "CustomRegionsMap.js", with "text/javascript" as the type

Paste the copied Javascript code into the visualization

Select the "Manage" button and "Libraries" from the menu

The top section is called "Included Libraries"; the bottom section is "Available Libraries".  Drag "us-states.js", "us-counties.js", "us-zipcodes.js" from the top section to the bottom, removing them from the active project

Still in the "Manage Libraries" dialog click the green "Add" button.  

Select "Choose file", browse to where you unzipped the downloaded custom_regions.zip file and find `custom_regions/libs/test_region_level1`, click "Open".  Change the name value to "test_region_level1.js" and click "Upload"
Repeat the process for "test_region_level2.js" and "test_region_level3.js"

In the "Manage Libraries" dialog drag all three of the newly added libraries from the bottom of the list (Scroll down) to the top section.  Click "Accept" when downloaded

Click the "Manage" button, select "Variables"

On the "Query" tab change the name of the "State" variable to "region"

On the "Constants" tab delete the "Tile Provier", "Limit", "County", "Tile Provider API Key", "Zip Code" variables (leaving "Chart Description" and "Chart Name" as the only two items in the Constants tab).  Click "Accept"







Proceed with the [main instructions](./Home.md) to configure.
